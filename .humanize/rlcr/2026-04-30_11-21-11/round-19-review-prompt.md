# FULL GOAL ALIGNMENT CHECK - Round 19

This is a **mandatory checkpoint** (at configurable intervals). You must conduct a comprehensive goal alignment audit.

## Original Implementation Plan

**IMPORTANT**: The original plan that Claude is implementing is located at:
@docs/handeye_ui_improvement_plan_humanize.md

You MUST read this plan file first to understand the full scope of work before conducting your review.

## Claude's Work Summary
<!-- CLAUDE's WORK SUMMARY START -->
## Fixed Issues

- Fixed `[P2] Treat stale frames as unavailable in quality APIs`.
  - Added a shared camera freshness window and stale-image handling for `get_latest_quality()`.
  - Live image rendering now returns a stale-stream placeholder instead of continuing to draw overlays on old cached frames.
  - Added a regression test that verifies stale cached images return `detected: false` with `reason_code: stale_image`.

- Fixed `[P2] Skip no-report sessions when choosing the latest archive`.
  - `latest_valid_session_id()` now returns the newest solution-backed session first, then the newest report-backed session, and returns `None` when only no-report archives exist.
  - Added regression tests for newer empty archives and all-empty archive lists.

- Fixed `[P3] Preserve archived sample overlays when current calibration changes`.
  - Archived sample previews now use saved sample metadata from `samples.jsonl` / `report.yaml` instead of re-running the current live detector and current `camera.yaml`.
  - Added a metadata overlay renderer for archived sample images.
  - Added a regression test that renders an archived overlay without requiring a live detector.

## Validation

- `python3 -m compileall -q src/paus_marker_ros2/paus_marker_ros2 src/paus_ui/paus_ui`
- `/usr/bin/python3 -m pytest -q src/paus_ui/tests src/paus_marker_ros2/tests/test_semi_auto_calibration.py src/paus_marker_ros2/tests/test_eye_to_hand_session.py`
  - `32 passed`
- `colcon build --packages-select paus_marker_ros2 paus_ui --symlink-install`
  - `2 packages finished`

## Unresolved Issues

- None.

## BitLesson Delta

- Action: none
- Lesson ID(s): NONE
- `.humanize/bitlesson.md` was read before coding.
- `bitlesson-selector` was attempted, but the command is unavailable on the lab host (`bitlesson-selector: missing`).

## Part 1: Goal Tracker Audit (MANDATORY)

Read @/home/chen_lab/worktrees/paus_robot_handeye_rlcr/.humanize/rlcr/2026-04-30_11-21-11/goal-tracker.md and verify:

### 1.1 Acceptance Criteria Status
For EACH Acceptance Criterion in the IMMUTABLE SECTION:
| AC | Status | Evidence (if MET) | Blocker (if NOT MET) | Justification (if DEFERRED) |
|----|--------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| AC-1 | MET / PARTIAL / NOT MET / DEFERRED | ... | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### 1.2 Forgotten Items Detection
Compare the original plan (@docs/handeye_ui_improvement_plan_humanize.md) with the current goal-tracker:
- Are there tasks that are neither in "Active", "Completed", nor "Deferred"?
- Are there tasks marked "complete" in summaries but not verified?
- List any forgotten items found.

### 1.3 Deferred Items Audit
For each item in "Explicitly Deferred":
- Is the deferral justification still valid?
- Should it be un-deferred based on current progress?
- Does it contradict the Ultimate Goal?

### 1.4 Goal Completion Summary
```
Acceptance Criteria: X/Y met (Z deferred)
Active Tasks: N remaining
Estimated remaining rounds: ?
Critical blockers: [list if any]
```

## Part 2: Implementation Review

- Conduct a deep critical review of the implementation
- Verify Claude's claims match reality
- Identify any gaps, bugs, or incomplete work
- Reference @docs for design documents

## Part 3: ## Goal Tracker Update Requests (YOUR RESPONSIBILITY)

**Important**: Claude cannot directly modify `goal-tracker.md` after Round 0. If Claude's summary contains a "Goal Tracker Update Request" section, YOU must:

1. **Evaluate the request**: Is the change justified? Does it serve the Ultimate Goal?
2. **If approved**: Update @/home/chen_lab/worktrees/paus_robot_handeye_rlcr/.humanize/rlcr/2026-04-30_11-21-11/goal-tracker.md yourself with the requested changes:
   - Move tasks between Active/Completed/Deferred sections as appropriate
   - Add entries to "Plan Evolution Log" with round number and justification
   - Add new issues to "Open Issues" if discovered
   - **NEVER modify the IMMUTABLE SECTION** (Ultimate Goal and Acceptance Criteria)
3. **If rejected**: Include in your review why the request was rejected

Common update requests you should handle:
- Task completion: Move from "Active Tasks" to "Completed and Verified"
- New issues: Add to "Open Issues" table
- Plan changes: Add to "Plan Evolution Log" with your assessment
- Deferrals: Only allow with strong justification; add to "Explicitly Deferred"

## Part 4: Progress Stagnation Check (MANDATORY for Full Alignment Rounds)

To implement the original plan at @docs/handeye_ui_improvement_plan_humanize.md, we have completed **20 iterations** (Round 0 to Round 19).

The project's `.humanize/rlcr/2026-04-30_11-21-11/` directory contains the history of each round's iteration:
- Round input prompts: `round-N-prompt.md`
- Round output summaries: `round-N-summary.md`
- Round review prompts: `round-N-review-prompt.md`
- Round review results: `round-N-review-result.md`

**How to Access Historical Files**: Read the historical review results and summaries using file paths like:
- `@.humanize/rlcr/2026-04-30_11-21-11/round-18-review-result.md` (previous round)
- `@.humanize/rlcr/2026-04-30_11-21-11/round-17-review-result.md` (2 rounds ago)
- `@.humanize/rlcr/2026-04-30_11-21-11/round-18-summary.md` (previous summary)

**Your Task**: Review the historical review results, especially the **recent rounds** of development progress and review outcomes, to determine if the development has stalled.

**Signs of Stagnation** (circuit breaker triggers):
- Same issues appearing repeatedly across multiple rounds
- No meaningful progress on Acceptance Criteria over several rounds
- Claude making the same mistakes repeatedly
- Circular discussions without resolution
- No new code changes despite continued iterations
- Codex giving similar feedback repeatedly without Claude addressing it

**If development is stagnating**, write **STOP** (as a single word on its own line) as the last line of your review output @/home/chen_lab/worktrees/paus_robot_handeye_rlcr/.humanize/rlcr/2026-04-30_11-21-11/round-19-review-result.md instead of COMPLETE.

## Part 5: Output Requirements

- If issues found OR any AC is NOT MET (including deferred ACs), write your findings to @/home/chen_lab/worktrees/paus_robot_handeye_rlcr/.humanize/rlcr/2026-04-30_11-21-11/round-19-review-result.md
- Include specific action items for Claude to address
- **If development is stagnating** (see Part 4), write "STOP" as the last line
- **CRITICAL**: Only write "COMPLETE" as the last line if ALL ACs from the original plan are FULLY MET with no deferrals
  - DEFERRED items are considered INCOMPLETE - do NOT output COMPLETE if any AC is deferred
  - The ONLY condition for COMPLETE is: all original plan tasks are done, all ACs are met, no deferrals allowed
