# Code Review - Round 7

## Original Implementation Plan

**IMPORTANT**: The original plan that Claude is implementing is located at:
@docs/handeye_ui_improvement_plan_humanize.md

You MUST read this plan file first to understand the full scope of work before conducting your review.
This plan contains the complete requirements and implementation details that Claude should be following.

Based on the original plan and @/home/chen_lab/worktrees/paus_robot_handeye_rlcr/.humanize/rlcr/2026-04-30_11-21-11/round-7-prompt.md, Claude claims to have completed the work. Please conduct a thorough critical review to verify this.

Below is Claude's summary of the work completed:

# Review Round 7 Summary

## Issues Fixed
- `[P1] Derive UI safety/config state from the backend, not local params`
- `[P2] Make --trajectory-path affect the node you are driving`

## Resolution
- Added backend calibration configuration fields to every `eye_to_hand_calibration_node` status payload: `execute_motion`, `trajectory_path`, `session_root_path`, `output_path`, and quality thresholds.
- Switched `/eye_to_hand/status` publisher and UI/CLI subscribers to transient-local reliable QoS so a UI or CLI started after the calibration node can still receive the latest backend state.
- Updated `UiRosBridge` to synchronize effective safety and path state from backend status before reporting status, reading sessions/waypoints, building motion summaries, and starting runs.
- Updated the browser flow so dry-run is blocked unless backend status confirms `execute_motion=false`; the start button now prompts when backend motion state is true or unknown.
- Changed CLI `--trajectory-path` semantics from a local-only check to a backend verification option. The CLI now reads backend status, uses the node trajectory path for local checks, and rejects mismatched custom paths with an explicit restart instruction.

## Validation
- `python3 -m compileall -q src/paus_marker_ros2/paus_marker_ros2 src/paus_ui/paus_ui`
- `node --check src/paus_ui/paus_ui/static/app.js`
- `/usr/bin/python3 -m pytest -q src/paus_marker_ros2/tests/test_semi_auto_calibration.py src/paus_ui/tests` passed: 15 tests.
- `colcon build --packages-select paus_marker_ros2 paus_ui --symlink-install` passed.

## Unresolved
- None known.

## BitLesson Delta
- Action: none
- Lesson ID(s): NONE
- Notes: `.humanize/bitlesson.md` only contains the template. `bitlesson-select.sh` was attempted but cannot run on the lab host because `jq` is unavailable and the default selector config is malformed.

## Part 1: Implementation Review

- Your task is to conduct a deep critical review, focusing on finding implementation issues and identifying gaps between "plan-design" and actual implementation.
- Relevant top-level guidance documents, phased implementation plans, and other important documentation and implementation references are located under @docs.
- If Claude planned to defer any tasks to future phases in its summary, DO NOT follow its lead. Instead, you should force Claude to complete ALL tasks as planned.
  - Such deferred tasks are considered incomplete work and should be flagged in your review comments, requiring Claude to address them.
  - If Claude planned to defer any tasks, please explore the codebase in-depth and draft a detailed implementation plan. This plan should be included in your review comments for Claude to follow.
  - Your review should be meticulous and skeptical. Look for any discrepancies, missing features, incomplete implementations.
- If Claude does not plan to defer any tasks, but honestly admits that some tasks are still pending (not yet completed), you should also include those pending tasks in your review.
  - Your review should elaborate on those unfinished tasks, explore the codebase, and draft an implementation plan.
  - A good engineering implementation plan should be **singular, directive, and definitive**, rather than discussing multiple possible implementation options.
  - The implementation plan should be **unambiguous**, internally consistent, and coherent from beginning to end, so that **Claude can execute the work accurately and without error**.

## Part 2: Goal Alignment Check (MANDATORY)

Read @/home/chen_lab/worktrees/paus_robot_handeye_rlcr/.humanize/rlcr/2026-04-30_11-21-11/goal-tracker.md and verify:

1. **Acceptance Criteria Progress**: For each AC, is progress being made? Are any ACs being ignored?
2. **Forgotten Items**: Are there tasks from the original plan that are not tracked in Active/Completed/Deferred?
3. **Deferred Items**: Are deferrals justified? Do they block any ACs?
4. **Plan Evolution**: If Claude modified the plan, is the justification valid?

Include a brief Goal Alignment Summary in your review:
```
ACs: X/Y addressed | Forgotten items: N | Unjustified deferrals: N
```

## Part 3: ## Goal Tracker Update Requests (YOUR RESPONSIBILITY)

**Important**: Claude cannot directly modify `goal-tracker.md` after Round 0. If Claude's summary contains a "Goal Tracker Update Request" section, YOU must:

1. **Evaluate the request**: Is the change justified? Does it serve the Ultimate Goal?
2. **If approved**: Update @/home/chen_lab/worktrees/paus_robot_handeye_rlcr/.humanize/rlcr/2026-04-30_11-21-11/goal-tracker.md yourself with the requested changes:
   - Move tasks between Active/Completed/Deferred sections as appropriate
   - Add entries to "Plan Evolution Log" with round number and justification
   - Add new issues to "Open Issues" if discovered
   - **NEVER modify the IMMUTABLE SECTION** (Ultimate Goal and Acceptance Criteria)
3. **If rejected**: Include in your review why the request was rejected

Common update requests you should handle:
- Task completion: Move from "Active Tasks" to "Completed and Verified"
- New issues: Add to "Open Issues" table
- Plan changes: Add to "Plan Evolution Log" with your assessment
- Deferrals: Only allow with strong justification; add to "Explicitly Deferred"

## Part 4: Output Requirements

- In short, your review comments can include: problems/findings/blockers; claims that don't match reality; implementation plans for deferred work (to be implemented now); implementation plans for unfinished work; goal alignment issues.
- If after your investigation the actual situation does not match what Claude claims to have completed, or there is pending work to be done, output your review comments to @/home/chen_lab/worktrees/paus_robot_handeye_rlcr/.humanize/rlcr/2026-04-30_11-21-11/round-7-review-result.md.
- **CRITICAL**: Only output "COMPLETE" as the last line if ALL tasks from the original plan are FULLY completed with no deferrals
  - DEFERRED items are considered INCOMPLETE - do NOT output COMPLETE if any task is deferred
  - UNFINISHED items are considered INCOMPLETE - do NOT output COMPLETE if any task is pending
  - The ONLY condition for COMPLETE is: all original plan tasks are done, all ACs are met, no deferrals or pending work allowed
- The word COMPLETE on the last line will stop Claude.
